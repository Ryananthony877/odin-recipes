   <h3>Some Homemade Vegan Tacos</h3>
   <p>"I loved this recipe, even my strictly carnivorous boyfriend enjoyed it. I brush the outside of the tortillas with a olive oil-lime juice mixture before throwing them in the oven and left them there for a little longer than the recipe called for".</p> <p>"This is a good idea but it's a little boring as is. It's not much more than guacamole in a tortilla. I love avocados and eat them plain all the time but if they're in a taco I'd like to have other ingredients such as tomato lettuce and maybe some."</p>
